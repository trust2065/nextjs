The story was back to 2017, the time when we were still in Taiwan.
A man came to visit our city and we had a few chats about where he is from, Australia.

From his talk, we know the country is a **slow pace, friendly, and open-mind** place which deeply attract me. Then we decided to give it a try, and made it fast!
After a few months of research, we landed Perth, Western Australia.
